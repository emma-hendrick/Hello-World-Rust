# Overview

I am trying to learn rust as it is one of the most popular backend programming languages currently.

This program simply prints hello world to the terminal.

In order to execute it, install the files, and from the hello_world directory, run
`cargo run`

This was written just to explore rust syntax a little bit, you know what a hello world program is.
